    Support for various web servers are provided in htdocs-run submodules,
    which work by adhering to the following conventions:

    -   The submodule is named 'htdocs-run-<modulename>'

    -   In its global.mk, the submodule add its name to the list of
        HTDOCS_RUN_MODULES

    -   In its project.mk, the submodule defines a HTDOCS_RUN_<NAME>_run
        variable containing the shell command to launch the web browser


    Refer to the 'htdocs-run-null' module for an example.
