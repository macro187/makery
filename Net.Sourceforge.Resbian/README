x.  Definitions


    Resource
      Named, external .NET objects of any type, retrievable by name at
      runtime.


    Resource set
      In the abstract, a collection of resources within which resource names
      are unique.  Represented in code by System.Resources.ResourceSet.


    .resources file
      Binary file format containing a resource set, usually with the
      filename extension ".resources".  System.Resources.ResourceWriter
      writes these files, and System.Resources.ResourceReader reads them.


    Embedded file
      A file of any kind embedded into an assembly via the linker's
      /embed switch or the compiler's (confusingly-named) /resource
      switch.


    ResourceManager
      An object that retrieves resources that apply to a particular class
      while allowing for culture-specific versions of each resource.  You
      ask it for a resource of a particular name, and it provides the most
      culture-specific version available for the currently-active (or a
      specified) culture.

      ResourceManager retrieves resources from embedded .resources files,
      each containing resources for one class in one language.  The
      embedded files adhere to a filename convention...

        <Namespace>.<Type>[.<culture>].resources

      ...which indicates the class and culture that the contained
      resources apply to, eg. "Com.MyNameSpace.MyType.en_US.resources".
      Omitting a culture from the filename indicates the neutral/invariant
      culture.
