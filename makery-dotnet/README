    Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Represents creation of a .dll library or .exe program from some source
    code files.  Because you can program .NET in different languages, this
    module captures the lowest common subset.  You are required to
    MODULES_use an appropriate language-specific module in addition to
    dotnet.  Also note that because .NET compilers are responsible for
    compiling AND linking, the dotnet module doesn't provide any rules
    itself - the entire task of compiling and linking is left to the
    language-specific module to implement.
