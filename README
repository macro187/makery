    Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Makery is a build system that is:

    -   Lightweight.  Requires only a shell, GNU Make, and standard
        command-line tools.

    -   Multi-project.  Handles multiple projects within a single Make
        invocation. [1]

    -   Modular.  Functionality is implemented in modules, which can
        depend on one another.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Projects
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Projects are the logical units that one builds with Makery.  Generally,
    a project consists of a Makefile plus source materials for building one
    or more closely-related output artifacts such as an executable or a
    library.

    Because Makery is designed to be extended through its module system to
    build all kinds of different artifacts, the exact definition of a
    project varies.  Typical examples of kinds of projects might include:

    -   A docbook book

    -   A .NET library written in C#

    -   A program written in C

    -   A suite of related C# programs, each implemented in its own
        project, distributed together as a package

    Often, projects depend on other projects.  For example, a program may
    require one or more libraries.  Those libraries may themselves require
    other libraries, and so on.  Projects declare their direct requirements,
    and Makery includes a mechanism that recursively resolves dependencies
    and sources all required projects.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Modules
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Modules group related build functionality into self-contained, reusable,
    redistributable packages.  For example, different modules might contain
    functionality to:

    -   Locate source code files

    -   Create rules that perform preprocessing on source code files

    -   Locate compilers and create rules that use them to compile
        source code files

    -   Locate linkers and create rules that use them to link object
        files into programs or libraries

    -   Locate document processing programs and create rules that use
        them to generate documents from source markup

    -   Make projects executable in-place by assembling required
        artifacts from other projects

    -   Package artifacts from multiple projects into distribution
        archives

    Modules may depend on functionality from other modules.  Each module
    declares its direct requirements, and Makery recursively resolves
    dependencies and sources the required modules.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Configs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A given project can take on slightly different flavours depending on
    build options or conditions under which the build occurs.  Each project
    can be thought of as having multiple instances, one for each unique
    configuration.

    Makery provides a framework for defining different config fields,
    available options for each, masks for currently-unavailable options,
    etc.  At build time, default options are computed for each field,
    resulting in a default config, which is used for the build.  These
    default options can then be overridden on the build command line where
    desired.

    Examples of config fields include:

    -   Target operating system

    -   Target processor architecture

    -   Brand of compiler

    -   Whether debug code, symbols, etc. are present
