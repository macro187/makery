    Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Provides phony "build" targets which build a basic set of target(s).

    The build targets don't do anything on their own.  Other modules attach
    their own targets as appropriate.

    Build targets are intended to imply a default, minimal set of target(s).
    Optional stuff like documentation, tests, distributables, etc. are
    appropriate for the "everything" phony targets provided by the
    "everything" module.
