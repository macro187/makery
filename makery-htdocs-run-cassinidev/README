    Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    CassiniDev (http://cassinidev.codeplex.com/) is a little open-source
    .NET development web server.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Setup
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    1.  Download the latest CassiniDev from the homepage.

    2.  As of this writing CassiniDev includes no setup program, so just
        extract the contents of the archive to %programfiles%\CassiniDev.

    3.  This module will take it from there
