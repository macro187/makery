    Introduction

    Special project variables known as "configuration fields" that affect
    the way a project is built.  Each field has a priority-ordered list of
    options, some of which may be masked (unavailable) in the current build
    environment.  The highest-priority available option will be
    selected automatically by default, or a particular option can be
    specified through the environment or the make invocation.

        #
        # TODO Fill out this example
        #
        $(call CONFIG_DeclareField,CONFIG_test)
        CONFIG_test_DESC ?= A test config field
        CONFIG_test_ALL = a b c d e

        CONFIG_test_MASK_BAD = c e
        CONFIG_test_MASK_BAD_DESC ?= Theyre bad!
        CONFIG_test_MASKS += BAD

        CONFIG_test_MASK_HATEA = a
        CONFIG_test_MASK_HATEA_DESC ?= I hate A!
        CONFIG_test_MASKS += HATEA
